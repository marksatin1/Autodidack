            When the pandemic hit New York City in March 2020 I had just rediscovered my love for
            film photography. Armed with a couple of cameras and a glut of free time I began
            crisscrossing the city&apos;s deserted neighborhoods in search of interesting subject
            matter and a way to kill time. Trying to pull something out of my own feelings of
            helplessness I experimented with any film stock I could get my hands on. I shot color
            and black and white. I shot slide film. I started using filters, flash, and lots of
            different lenses. I didn&apos;t know it but I was putting myself through a massive
            postgraduate program in photography. In the first three months of the pandemic I shot 42
            rolls of film: 1,512 carefully composed photos on 35mm.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pretty quickly I realized that I wasn&apos;t just working through my own struggles - I
            was documenting major historical turbulence on the daily. I shot NYC through the
            lockdown, during the initial lifting of restrictions and their many reintroductions,
            during the protests for George Floyd and the vigils for Breonna Taylor, the looting in
            SoHo and so much more.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then I moved beyond the city. I got in the car and drove, photographing my way through
            forests, plains, and deserts all across the country. I hiked national and state parks,
            climbed mountains, and camped in the backcountry. I explored forgotten towns, and
            trekked through American cities I never actually thought I&apos;d see. In that five week
            trip I shot another 22 rolls of film.
            <br />
            <br />
            Traveling alone on the road offers a lot of time for reflection, and it had become clear
            to me that I had been restless for a while - even before Covid arrived. I had just
            turned thirty and I was hungry for a career that would keep me just as engaged as the
            previous nine months had. And I wanted to combine my passion for making and studying art
            with my desire to build something new and exciting. But what could glue those two things
            together?
            <br />
            <br />
            Enter the internet.
            <br />
            <br />
            One day my uncle suggested I take a look at Harvard&apos;s CS50x, a free and online
            version of David J. Malan&apos;s famous undergrad computer science course. And the rest
            is history. By the end of the second lecture I was hooked. It&apos;s crazy but it really
            was that simple and that fast for me. Design, structure, and problem-solving modules
            taught me to think like an engineer and paved the way for full-stack web development. I
            completed the program and received my certificate. I moved deeper and deeper into web
            design, climbing from server-side templating languages to Single Page Applications to
            containerized microservices and back around to React Server Components, all the while
            iterating on what I had learned before, just as I had done with photography the previous
            year.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the same time I had graduated to the next level of my photography practice: medium
            format film. 6x7 film has nearly five times the surface area of 35mm, allowing me to
            capture nearly five times more composition without being forced to distort the image
            with a wide angle lens. It&apos;s also a helluva lot sharper and produces exponentially
            more colors than its kid brother can. Combined with everything I was learning in my
            ad-hoc coding bootcamp, it felt as if both my eyes and my brain were expanding.
            <br />
            <br />
            When it became clear that I was going to lasso my different pursuits into one portfolio
            I began brainstorming words and phrases that could encapsulate exactly what it is I have
            to offer. I reflected on my love of learning in and out of the classroom, and of trying
            new things and becoming empowered in pursuing new experiences, as well my boundless love
            for art and visual design. Returning from a trip to the Adirondacks one summer I eagerly
            developed my film and was deeply moved by the ethereal beauty of a waterfall I had
            photographed on Mt. Algonquin. With this feeling lodged in my brain it wasn&apos;t long
            before a new portmanteau was born: Autodidack, the union of a self-motivated learner
            seeking solace, knowledge, and epiphany in nature.

              When people ask me what kinds of photos I take I always take a pause because the
              answer isn&apos;t so straightforward. I find that I&apos;m always pulling the past
              behind me as I move into new phases of my work. What came before never really wants to
              let go. If you take a quick glance through my instagram you&apos;ll see lots and lots
              of empty spaces, but scroll back farther and you&apos;ll see a few years worth of
              portraits. Not to mention the occasional editorial or street series peppered in. The
              truth is I&apos;m not closed off to any concept, and this, combined with the
              art-adjacent nature of Medium Format photography, has sometimes landed me with the
              label of Fine Art Photographer. But I don&apos;t like that label so much – too stuffy
              and just as ambiguous as my initial pause.

                I love celluloid. Especially slide film. I shoot and develop all of the photography
                you see here plus digitize everything with my Epson Perfection V800 Photo scanner.
                Everything is painstakingly organized in Lightroom while color correction and
                cleaning is done in Photoshop.

                I love nature, hiking, camping, road trips…. but I&apos;m just as much in love with
                the city. I&apos;ve lived in NYC for over a decade and don&apos;t see myself leaving

                I&apos;m obsessed with geometric compositions. I often spend upwards of an hour on
                each shot and much of that time is spent adjusting the camera a few micrometers here
                and there to get the absolute perfect angle to my shots.
