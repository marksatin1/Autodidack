          <i>Autodidack</i> is a portmanteau of “autodidact” - a self-taught person - and “Adirondacks” -
          the name given to 5000 square miles of lush mountain range in upstate New York ......

        When the pandemic hit NYC in early 2020 I had just rediscovered my love of 35mm film. I
        hadn&#39;t photographed much of anything in the previous five years, but a new job renting
        film equipment to local productions had whet my appetite again. When Covid forced us to shutter our doors, I poured my energy into my photography, grabbing my cameras
        and crisscrossing deserted neighborhoods,
        mostly as a way to distract myself from the bleakness of daily life.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>This turned out to be a period of great experimentation that led to moments of real joy. I put myself through a crash course in photography, and made it my mission to expand my creative boundaries as much as possible, capturing initmate portraits of friends and strangers as well as cityscapes and street scenes subdued by a lack of traffic.
        I shot any film stock I could get my hands on. I started using filters daily, eventually learning to balance my exposures with a polarizer and ND gradients. I started using my tripod more, stopping way down on the aperture and exposing for longer periods of time. Photography was becoming less of a point-and-shoot activity and more and more
        an opportunity to merge my vision of things with the objects and spaces around me.

        Despite my productivity it was still strange to venture out into the stillness. My brain expected to constantly be surrounded by people,
        but nearly every time I rounded a corner I was met with nothing. Some neighborhoods were so dead I had to remind myself that millions of
        New Yorkers still lived here, locked up inside their apartments. As time pressed on I shifted my focus away from the lack of people and sank my teeth into the
        spaces I passed through, suddenly in tune with the buildings and neighborhoods in a way I had never been before.

        Two months into the pandemic George Floyd was murdered by a cop, and all those people burst out into the streets.
        For the second time in two months the
        social reality changed overnight. Breonna Taylor&#39;s name was quickly reinvoked, and justice was demanded for dozens of black Americans murdered by police.
        It felt as if people were fed up with being trapped - not just within their apartments but within a
        system that continued to empower the empowered and disadvantage the disadvantaged. Police brutality had persisted through a global pandemic and billions
        of people sat idly by in their homes. Now millions would march.

        I started photographing the protests immediately. I went to document history as an observer but quickly became a participant.
        Just by being present at rallies and by
        engaging with the community through my camera, I learned a lot about a section of society I had previoulsy so easily ignored.
        I listened to firsthand
        accounts of police brutality and heard from local activists dedicating their lives to
        social equality and legal protection for all citizens. I learned how journalists chose their stories and
        photographers shot them. I saw how media conglomerates wielded their influence and shaped the global narrative while grassroots community activism
        took root over social media and worked to present a real challenge to those companies.

        Since starting my artistic journey I had shot 38 rolls of film - more than 1300 photos. Walking
        and biking around the city had become my physical exercise, capturing day-to-day life my mental and emotional exercise.
        Each week I would get back the previous drop&#39;s photos from the lab. As I scanned images
        I could feel the anger and fear and resilience on people&#39;s faces. It charged the
        spaces I shot with a palpable intensity, something that struck a chord in me and didn&#39;t leave. It also made me realize just how much had changed in three months:
        I had photos of Broadway boarded up and empty; of masked shopkeepers behind hanging sheets
        of plastic; of looters in SoHo and protestors in Greenwich Village; of marches across
        Houston Street and over FDR Drive. In June alone I shot 14 more rolls.

        In the middle of the summer I took a trip to Bethany Beach, Delaware and then back home to
        Maryland. I wanted to see how people in the suburbs were handling the lockdown as Covid
        cases spread outwards from NYC. It was strange to weather the storm with my family after living in something like solitary confinement for so long,
        and witnessing the pandemic from this angle made me realize that I had only experienced our historical turbulence from a couple of limited perspectives.
        On top of everything else, this was an
        election year - one that would determine if Donald Trump got a second term - and I wanted to know how oridinary Americans were handling the mass unrest.
        A few weeks before Election Day I left home and embarked on a road trip across the country, checking off a
        bucket list item and capturing irrefutable evidence of a nation left behind by its
        leaders. I made my way across eighteen states, talking with people along the way and photographing both treasured national parks and
        the forgotten towns between them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Traveling on the road alone gives you a lot of time to think. In that environment it became clear to me that the restlessness
        I had been documenting was not just national, but my own. I had tried many different jobs in my
        twenties, and liked aspects of all of them, but never quite felt like I had found my niche. Returning home after five weeks on the road, I was intent on finding something that would engage and excite me as
        much as the last eight months had. Journalistic photography had changed my life but I didn&#39;t just want to report on
        current events; I wanted to interact with them and produce art from those interactions. And I wanted that art to build towards something cohesive - but what?
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The answer presented itself in the most unsuspecting way possible. One day my
        uncle told me in passing about a free online computer science course called
        CS50x. He saw software engineering as the future of all industries and had heard good things about this class. I enrolled and by
        the end of the first lecture I was hooked. Over the course of five months I realized that I
        actually had an engineering brain, but that I hadn&#39;t had the opportunity to use it as
        much as I would have liked. In a way, this made sense to me. After all, as a Producer and
        Lighting Designer on short films and commercials I had had to engineer solutions to complex
        logistical problems all the time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In this course I began to see the posibilities of connecting my art to robust user experiences on the web.
        The internet is utilitarian, but it&#39;s also interactive and engaging, and navigating to a website didn&#39;t just
        have to be a utilitarian experience: retrieving information from a web page
        could combine the story of a great television show, the UI of
        a great video game, and the educational environment of an on-demand virtual classroom.
        As humans we have a spiritual need for art in our lives, to continuously see creativity
        expressed around us in new and interesting ways. I believe we become unhappy when we
        don&#39;t have access to art: it excites us even when we&#39;re incapable of finding words
        to describe that excitement.

        When it became clear that I was going to lasso my varying pursuits into one portfolio I
        began brainstorming words and phrases that could encapsulate my experiences over this year. I reflected on my love of learning in and out of the classroom, and of trying new
        things and becoming empowered by my pursuit of new experiences. Returning from a trip to the
        Adirondacks one summer I eagerly developed my film and was moved deeply by the ethereal
        beauty of a waterfall I had photographed on Mt. Algonquin. The memory of this moment lodged
        itself in my brain, and a new portmanteau was born: Autodidack, a
        self-motivated learner seeking solace, knowledge, and epiphany in nature. In my artistic and engineering practice
        I hope to impart this same emotion in you, the viewer.
