          Autodidack is a portmanteau of “autodidact” - a self-taught person - and “Adirondacks” -
          the name given to the 5000 square miles of lush mountain range in upstate New York.

        When the pandemic hit NYC in early 2020 I had just rediscovered my passion for 35mm film. I
        hadn&#39;t photographed much of anything in the previous five years, but a new job renting
        film equipment to local productions had whet my appetite again. Armed with a couple of
        cameras and a glut of free time I began crisscrossing the city&#39;s deserted neighborhoods
        simply as a way to get out of the house and distract myself from the bleakness of daily life
        under Covid. This was a period of great experimentation that led to moments of real joy. I
        made it my mission to expand my boundaries as much as possible: I shot people I knew and
        didn&#39;t know, random animals, empty places, nature, the city, anything. I shot any film
        stock I could get my hands on: black and white, color, Kodak, Fuji, slides, Ilford. I
        learned how to use diffusion filters and a polarizer. I set my apertures wide open and
        stopped them all the way down.

        When I ventured out I always expected to see someone around the next corner but I rarely
        did. And when I did, they seemed to be pulled quickly past me by the spirit of a hurried
        traveler. Some neighborhoods were so dead I had to keep reminding myself that millions of
        New Yorkers were still all around me, locked up a few stories higher inside their
        apartments.

        Two months into this mess, George Floyd was murdered. For the second time in two months the
        social reality changed drastically overnight. Suddenly everyone had a reason to go outside
        again: people were fed up with being trapped, not just within their apartments, but within a
        system that continued to empower the empowered and disadvantage the disadvantaged. Not even
        a global pandemic could stop police from murdering black people, and now no one could ignore
        that fact.

        The Roman philosopher Seneca said, “Luck is when preparation meets opportunity”. Since
        starting my artistic journey I had shot 38 rolls of film, or more than 1300 photos. Walking
        and biking around the city had become my daily exercise: capturing the day-to-day through my
        lens tricked me into believing I was dealing with my own part of our collective grief. In
        reality that processing would come much later, in layers that washed over me each of the
        thousands of times I looked at my developed photos.

        I started photographing the protests immediately. Just by being present at rallies, and by
        engaging with the community through my camera, I learned so much: I listened to firsthand
        accounts of police brutality and heard from local activists dedicating their lives to true
        social equality and legal protection; I learned how journalists chooses their stories and
        photographers shoot them; I learned about the advantages of big media companies and the
        disadvantages of promoting community activism over social media.

        Each week I would get back the previous drop&#39;s photos from the labs. As I reviewed the
        scans I could feel the anger and fear and resilience on people&#39;s faces. It charged the
        spaces I shot with a palpable intensity, something that struck a chord in me beyond the
        scope of current events. It also made me realize just how much had changed in three months:
        I had photos of Broadway boarded up and empty; of masked shopkeepers behind hanging sheets
        of plastic; of looters in SoHo and protestors in Greenwich Village; of marches across
        Houston Street and over FDR Drive. In June alone I shot 14 rolls.

        In the middle of the summer I took a trip to Bethany Beach, DE and then back home to
        Maryland. I wanted to see how people in the suburbs were handling the lockdown as Covid
        cases spread outwards from NYC. From there I took a road trip across the country, fulfilling
        a bucket list item and capturing irrefutable evidence of a nation left behind by its
        leaders. Another dimension to the fear and anger began to reveal itself. This was an
        election year - the one that would determine whether Donald Trump would get a second term -
        and I made my way across eighteen states, talking with people, photographing them and their
        highways and homes, their state parks and our national treasures.

        Traveling on the road alone gave me a lot of time to think. It was becoming clear to me that
        I&#39;d been feeling restless for a long time. I had tried many different jobs in my
        twenties but hadn&#39;t found a career I cared about for long enough. I loved New York but
        also felt trapped by it. But now my own anger, my own sense of feeling stuck, had been given
        national appreciation, and I couldn&#39;t ignore it any longer.

        Upon returning home I was intent on finding something that would engage and excite me as
        much as the last eight months had. Journalistic photography had changed my life but I knew
        that lifestyle was not the right fit for me full-time. Besides, I didn&#39;t just want to
        report on current events; I wanted to make art that could stand apart from the day-to-day. I
        also wanted to build something; the question was what to build. I&#39;ve always loved
        learning, even for its own sake, but what would I learn next?
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The answer ended up presenting itself in the most unsuspecting way possible. One day my
        uncle told me in passing that Harvard offered a free online computer science course called
        CS50x. He saw CS as the future and had heard good things about this class. I enrolled and by
        the end of the first lecture I was hooked. Over the course of five months I realized that I
        actually had an engineering brain, but that I hadn&#39;t had the opportunity to use it as
        much as I would have liked. Despite not possessing this understanding previously, it
        actually made complete sense to me once I gave it some thought. After all, as a Producer and
        Lighting Designer on short films and commercials, I had to engineer solutions to complex
        logistical problems all the time.

        It was at this time that I began to see the possibilities of uniting visual storytelling
        with well-thought-out user experiences on the web. Navigating to a website didn&#39;t just
        have to be a utilitarian concern: the experience of getting new information from a web page
        could combine aspects of the story of a great television show, the user interactivity of
        your favorite video game, and the educational environment of an on-demand virtual classroom.

        Since getting my first computer at age nine I&#39;ve had a real fondness for the novelty of
        the web. While I love how fast the internet has become and how robust web apps are, I do
        miss the wild west ethos of early online spaces. I miss not knowing what&#39;s at the end of
        the next link. I miss knowing that any piece of information presented in any myriad number
        of ways could be around that corner.
      </p>

        As humans we have a big spiritual need for art in our lives, to continuously see creativity
        expressed around us in new and interesting ways. Frankly, we become unhappy when we
        don&#39;t have access to art: it excites us even when we&#39;re incapable of finding words
        to describe that excitement. My engineering and artistic practice is based in combining the
        creativity and seeming entropy of Web 1.0 with the agile practices of the modern Software
        Development Life Cycle.

        When it became clear that I was going to lasso my varying pursuits into one portfolio I
        began brainstorming words and phrases that could encapsulate exactly what it is I have to
        offer. I reflected on my love of learning in and out of the classroom, and of trying new
        things and becoming empowered by my pursuit of new experiences. Returning from a trip to the
        Adirondacks one summer I eagerly developed my film and was moved deeply by the ethereal
        beauty of a waterfall I had photographed on Mt. Algonquin. The memory of this moment lodged
        itself in my brain, and a new portmanteau was born: Autodidack, the union of a
        self-motivated learner seeking solace, knowledge, and epiphany in nature.
