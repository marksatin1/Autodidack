      My name is Mark Satin.
      <br />
      <br />
      I&#39;m a Full-Stack Web Developer and Fine Art Photographer living in Brooklyn, NY.
      <br />
      <br />
      I started my professional journey as a Film & Television major at NYU&#39;s Tisch School of
      the Arts where I honed my eye for stark geometric compositions and evocative lighting. For the
      next six years I worked as a Producer and Gaffer on commercials, music videos, and other short
      form content.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since the early days of Web 1.0 I&#39;ve enjoyed getting lost in the internet. As
      infrastructure moved to the cloud and static web sites evolved into reactive web apps I began
      to see the possibilities for uniting visual storytelling and thoughtful design into a new
      interactive product for people to experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      With a strong foundation in DSA, Object-Oriented Programming, and modern web development from
      HarvardX, Google, and Udemy, I&#39;ve turned this vision into a reality.
