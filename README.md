### Context

At the outset my goal for this website was to encourage users to learn about me and my work by "playing", or interacting, with the site itself. In addition to the photographic and development work showcased herein, Autodidack uses animations, touch guestures, audio cues, and original music (by HASH) to transform the typically static page-to-page user journey into a dynamic experience that feels more like visiting your favorite destination than slogging through a collection of web pages.

## Jump in and stay a while. The water's perfect!
